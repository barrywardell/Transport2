Transport 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numerical code for integrating the transport equation for V0 (appearing in the
Hadamard form of the Green function for the wave equation in curved spacetime)
along a geodesic.

Getting the code
----------------
To get the code, run

git clone --recursive git://github.com/barrywardell/transport2

Compiling
---------
This code requires the GNU Scientific Library 
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). Once the GSL is installed,
the code can be compiled by running 'make'.

Usage
-----
The code parameters for the geodesic are currently hardcoded
into the main function in transport.cc. There are no command line
arguments available.
